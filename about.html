            The following text is all taken from <a href="https://copypastatext.com/freddy-five-bear/"> Five Bear</a>

        <p style="color:blue; font-size:20px;">
            At least they didn’t give birth to Freddy Fazbear. Because if you give birth to Freddy five bears he comes out and he says “or or or or or or or or or orrrr” and then he kills Michael Afton. 
            <br>
            Or he tries to do it along with his friends. Bunny the Bonnie. Chica the Kitchen. Foxy the fox pirate rawr and yellow Freddy who’s weird and but it’s not his fault. 
            <br>
            It’s all because William Afton one day was like “hi I’m gonna murder people raggh.” So he murdered kids but he was also a yellow bunny and he was like “hi. I’m yellow bunny. 
            <br>
            Imma kill you” because he had a daughter who had like remnant gone from her? So he was like “if I kill kids I put them in the suits!” So this… It’s not Freddy five best fault it’s purple guy fault. 
            <br>
            And that’s why you don’t give birth to him.
